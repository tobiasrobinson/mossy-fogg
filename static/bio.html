			<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>More captivating than a Venus Fly Trap, more melodious <br />
than a little yellow canary and able to silence a room with<br />
a single strum. Turin Robinson aka Mossy Fogg translates <br />
his red centre roots into an emotional and charismatic <br />
presence on stage.<br />
A smooth word twister his genre can be described as <br />
folksy, hip hop, rock & roll, rhythm & blues acoustic action, <br />
with his voice swinging through a spectrum of Jeff <br />
Buckley-ish to Tom Waits-ish on demand.<br />
Playing live music to audiences for over almost two <br />
decades, he boasts an impressive collection of originals <br />
and a great variety of covers that he truly makes his own.<br />
Turin has spread his musical loving all around the place <br />
as a lone wolf, collaborating as much as he can as well as <br />
fronting various bands.<br />
Notable performances include supporting Glenn Shorack, <br />
Wendy Matthews, Eskimo Joe and Mental As Anything.<br />
But when all is said and done, Turin is perhaps best <br />
known for the role as instigator and facilitator of Open Mic <br />
nights and Jam Sessions around town and country.<br />
From humble beginnings way before years started in ‘20’, <br />
Mossy Fogg has been using his siren song to pull <br />
unsuspecting musicians and the musically minded away <br />
from the mundane and into the crook of his acoustic arm.
