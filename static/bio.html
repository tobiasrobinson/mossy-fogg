			<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>More captivating than a Venus Fly Trap, more melodious than a little yellow canary and able to silence a room with a single strum. Turin Robinson translates his red centre roots into an emotional and charismatic presence on stage.</p>

<p>A smooth word twister his genre can be described as folksy, hip hop, rock & roll, rhythm & blues acoustic action with his voice swinging through a spectrum of Jeff Buckley-ish to Tom Waits-ish on demand.</p>

<p>Playing live music to audiences for over almost two decades, he boasts an impressive collection of originals and a great variety of covers which he truly makes his own.</p>

<p>Consistently furthering the rumour that there’s something in the water in Perth, Turin has spread his musical loving up and down the West Coast as a lone wolf as well as recent notable performances including twice supporting Mental As Anything in 2009 and 2010.</p>

<p>But when all is said and done, Turin is perhaps best known for the role as instigator and facilitator of Rosie’s Open Mic & Jam Session at the Rosemount Hotel, North Perth. From humble beginnings way before years started in ‘20’, Turin has been using his siren song to pull unsuspecting musicians and the musically minded away from the streets of North Perth and into the crook of his acoustic arm.</p>
